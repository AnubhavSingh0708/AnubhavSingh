speech recognition<br>
here speech recognition is carried out by<br>

recognition.onresult : Another event handler that will run when the speech recognition service returns a result<br>
recognition.start() : This method will start the speech recognition service and start listening to incoming audio, running this code for the first time will show a dialog asking for access to your device microphone <br>
recognition.grammars : Used to set the grammars that will be understood by the speech recognition<br>
